# Community-Detection-NLPCA-HittingWalkTrap-Spectral
This project codes the algorithms presented in the paper "Community detection in directed graphs using stationary distribution and hitting times methods" (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13278-023-01080-1).

The algorithms include: the spectral method algorithm for optimizing the modularity function $Q_p$, Hitting times WalkTrap and Normalized Laplacian PCA (NL-PCA).
